# Astronomy at High Speed

This folder contains the scripts and data files needed to complete the
exercises associated with the *Astronomy at High Speed* section of
ThaiPASS 2021.

You should download all the files you see here (except for this README)
to a single folder of your PC or laptop. Then run the Jupyter notebook
*AstronomyAtHighSpeed.ipnb* to start the excercises.
