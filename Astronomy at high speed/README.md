# Astronomy at High Speed

This folder contains the scripts and data files needed to complete the
exercises associated with the *Astronomy at High Speed* section of
ThaiPASS 2021.

You should have all of the files on your PC/laptop if you have cloned the
ThaiPASS 2021 repository. Once you have, navigate your way to the
*Astronomy at high speed* folder, and start Jupyter notebook to run
the notebook you will see there.
